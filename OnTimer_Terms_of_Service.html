  <h1>OnTimer Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [December 6, 2025]</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the OnTimer mobile
    application (“OnTimer,” “the app,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). By downloading,
    installing, or using OnTimer, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you
    do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at:
    <a href="mailto:support@ontimer.app">support@ontimer.appm</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Description of Service</h2>
  <p>
    OnTimer is a mobile app that helps users avoid being late for meetings by
    reading their Google Calendar events and providing timely reminders. To
    provide this functionality, OnTimer may request read-only access to your
    Google Calendar data if you choose to connect your Google Account.
  </p>
  <p>
    OnTimer does <strong>not</strong> modify, delete, or create Google Calendar
    events; access is strictly read-only.
  </p>

  <h2>Eligibility</h2>
  <p>
    You must be at least 13 years old to use OnTimer. By using the app, you
    represent and warrant that you meet this requirement.
  </p>

  <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>By using OnTimer, you agree to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the app only for lawful purposes.</li>
    <li>Ensure that your device and account credentials remain secure.</li>
    <li>Take responsibility for managing your own notification settings.</li>
    <li>
      Not attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise tamper with the
      app or its services.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>User Data &amp; Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    When you connect your Google Account, you grant OnTimer permission to read
    your calendars and events using Google’s read-only Calendar scopes. This
    access is used solely to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify the calendars associated with your account.</li>
    <li>Read upcoming events.</li>
    <li>Send reminders and notifications related to those events.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    OnTimer does not write, modify, or delete events in your Google Calendar.
    Our access and data practices are described in detail in our Privacy
    Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your use of the app is also governed by our
    <a href="OnTimer_Privacy_Policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which is hereby
    incorporated into these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>Disconnection &amp; Revocation</h2>
  <p>You may disconnect your Google Account from OnTimer at any time by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using the relevant account or calendar settings within the app; or</li>
    <li>
      Visiting Google’s permissions page and revoking access:
      <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
      </a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Once disconnected or revoked, OnTimer will no longer be able to read your
    Google Calendar data.
  </p>

  <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    OnTimer, including its design, features, and content, is owned by its
    creator and is protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy,
    modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the app without prior
    written permission.
  </p>

  <h2>Service Availability and Changes</h2>
  <p>
    We strive to keep OnTimer reliable and available, but we do not guarantee
    that the app will always be uninterrupted, error-free, or compatible with
    every device or operating system. We may add, modify, or remove features at
    any time, and we may discontinue the app or any part of it without prior
    notice.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    OnTimer relies on third-party services such as Google Calendar APIs and
    mobile operating systems. We are not responsible for outages, changes, or
    limitations imposed by these third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the fullest extent permitted by law, OnTimer and its creator shall not
    be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive
    damages, or any loss of profits or data, arising out of or in connection
    with your use of the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    Without limiting the foregoing, OnTimer is not responsible for missed
    meetings, missed reminders, or any consequences resulting from notification
    failures, device issues, user configuration, or third-party service
    outages.
  </p>

  <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>
    OnTimer is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without
    warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not
    limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
    purpose, or non-infringement.
  </p>

  <h2>Indemnification</h2>
  <p>
    You agree to indemnify and hold harmless OnTimer and its creator from and
    against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including
    reasonable attorney’s fees, arising out of or in any way connected with
    your use of the app or violation of these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>Governing Law</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
    the United States and the State of New Jersey, without regard to its
    conflict of law principles.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update the
    “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use of OnTimer
    after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated Terms.

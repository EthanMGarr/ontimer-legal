    <h1>OnTimer Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="update-date">Last Updated: January 10, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using OnTimer ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>OnTimer is a meeting alarm application that connects to your calendar accounts (Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook) to provide notifications and reminders for your scheduled events. The App:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reads calendar data only</strong> - OnTimer accesses your calendar information in read-only mode</li>
        <li>Does not modify, create, or delete calendar events</li>
        <li>Provides notifications and alarms based on your calendar schedule</li>
        <li>Syncs periodically with your connected calendar accounts</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="important">
        <h3>⚠️ IMPORTANT LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
        <p><strong>NO GUARANTEE OF ALARM DELIVERY:</strong> OnTimer is provided as a convenience tool and does NOT guarantee that alarms or notifications will be delivered reliably or on time. Alarm delivery depends on factors outside our control including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your device's operating system settings and restrictions</li>
            <li>Network connectivity and calendar sync timing</li>
            <li>Background app refresh limitations</li>
            <li>Device battery optimization settings</li>
            <li>Silent mode, Do Not Disturb, and Focus mode settings</li>
            <li>iOS notification permissions and system-level restrictions</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR BEING ON TIME TO YOUR MEETINGS AND APPOINTMENTS.</strong> OnTimer is intended as a supplementary tool only. You should not rely exclusively on OnTimer for time-critical obligations.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>3. Calendar Access and Data Usage</h2>
    <p><strong>Read-Only Access:</strong> OnTimer requests read-only access to your calendar data through OAuth authentication. We:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only read your calendar events and associated metadata</li>
        <li>Do not modify, create, delete, or share your calendar events</li>
        <li>Do not access your emails, contacts, or other account data</li>
        <li>Store minimal calendar information locally on your device for notification purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can revoke calendar access at any time through your device settings or through your Google/Microsoft account security settings.</p>

    <h2>4. User Accounts and Subscriptions</h2>
    <p><strong>Free Version:</strong> The free version of OnTimer allows connection to one calendar account.</p>
    <p><strong>Premium Subscription:</strong> Premium subscribers can connect multiple calendar accounts and access additional features. Subscriptions are managed through the Apple App Store and are subject to Apple's Terms of Service.</p>
    <p><strong>Billing:</strong> All payments are processed by Apple. We do not store your payment information. Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</p>

        <li>We shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages</li>

  <h1>OnTimer Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [December 6, 2025]</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    OnTimer (“we,” “our,” or “us”) provides a mobile application designed to help
    users stay on time for meetings by reading upcoming calendar events and
    delivering timely reminders. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
    use, store, and protect your information, including information accessed
    through your Google Account.
  </p>
  <p>
    By using OnTimer, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
    If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have any questions, please contact us at:
    <a href="mailto:support@ontimer.app">support@ontimer.app</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>1. Information You Provide</h3>
  <p>We may collect information that you provide directly, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your email address (for support or communication, if you provide it).</li>
    <li>Reminder settings or preferences you configure within the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Information Accessed Through Google Calendar (Read-Only)</h3>
  <p>
    If you choose to connect your Google Account, OnTimer accesses the following
    <strong>read-only</strong> Google Calendar data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your list of Google calendars.</li>
    <li>Event titles.</li>
    <li>Event start and end times.</li>
    <li>Event locations.</li>
    <li>Event metadata (such as reminders or all-day flags).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    OnTimer <strong>does not</strong> create new events, modify existing events,
    delete events, or share your Google Calendar data with third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use Google Calendar Data</h2>
  <p>We use Google Calendar data only for the following limited purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To identify your calendars.</li>
    <li>To read upcoming events.</li>
    <li>To generate reminders before meetings.</li>
    <li>To display event information inside the app.</li>
    <li>To improve core app functionality and user experience.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> use your Google Calendar data for advertising,
    marketing, cross-user analytics, or sale to third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    All usage complies with the
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      Google API Services User Data Policy
    </a>,
    including the Limited Use requirements.
  </p>

  <h2>Local Device Storage</h2>
  <p>
    OnTimer does <strong>not</strong> store your Google Calendar event data on
    external or cloud servers. Event information is processed locally on your
    device and used solely to provide reminders and display your schedule.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not maintain separate server-side copies of your Google Calendar
    event data.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Disconnect or Revoke Access</h2>
  <p>You can disconnect your Google Account from OnTimer at any time by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using the account or calendar settings within the app, or</li>
    <li>
      Visiting Google’s permissions page and revoking access:
      <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
      </a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Once access is revoked, OnTimer will no longer be able to read or display
    your Google Calendar information.
  </p>

  <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal information or
    Google Calendar data. We also do not share your Google user data with third
    parties except in the following limited circumstances:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or request.</li>
    <li>To protect the rights, property, or safety of OnTimer, our users, or others.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not allow third-party advertisers or trackers to access your Google
    Calendar data through the app.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to help protect your
    information, including limiting data access to read-only Google Calendar
    scopes and processing calendar data locally on your device.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is completely
    secure. By minimizing server-side storage, we strive to reduce risk and
    exposure of your data.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    OnTimer is not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do not
    knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that
    we have received information from a child under 13, we will delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal
    data, including the right to access, correct, or delete certain information.
    To make a request, please contact us at

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will
    update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use
    of OnTimer after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated
    Privacy Policy.

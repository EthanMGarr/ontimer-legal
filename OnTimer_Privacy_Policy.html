        <h1>Privacy Policy for OnTimer</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 14, 2025</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>In Short:</strong> OnTimer helps you never miss a meeting by creating smart alarms from your calendar events. We only access your calendar event times and titles to create alarms - we never read notes, attendees, or share your data with anyone.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>OnTimer accesses and processes the following information to provide our alarm services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Calendar Event Data:</strong> We access event titles, start times, end times, and recurrence information from your Google Calendar to create timely alarms.</li>
            <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> We receive your email address through Google Sign-In for authentication purposes only.</li>
            <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> We store your alarm preferences (timing, alert style, business hours settings) locally on your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. What We DON'T Collect</h2>
        <p>Your privacy matters to us. OnTimer does NOT access, collect, or store:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Event notes or descriptions</li>
            <li>Event locations</li>
            <li>Meeting attendees or contacts</li>
            <li>Email content</li>
            <li>Any data from other apps</li>
            <li>Your location or activity data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the calendar event information solely to:</p>

            <li>Display upcoming events in the app</li>
            <li>Sync your calendar every 15 minutes to keep alarms up to date</li>
            <li>Apply your alarm preferences (timing, filters, business hours)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>That's it.</strong> We don't analyze your calendar for any other purpose, and we don't use your data for marketing, advertising, or analytics.</p>

        <h2>4. How We Store Your Data</h2>
